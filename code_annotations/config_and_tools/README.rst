config and tools
================

This directory will contain annotation configurations that can be shared across repositories, as well as shared tools based on these configurations, such as Sphinx extensions that can be used to document certain types of annotations.

These custom configurations should be kept separate from the general annotations tool in /code_annotations.

For more details, see the ADR in docs/decisions/0001-config-and-tools.rst.
